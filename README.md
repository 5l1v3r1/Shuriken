An Offensive Android Kernel on Steroids

Shuriken is an Android kernel for Oneplus 5/5T which supports multiple features for pentesting. It was specifically built for HackRF and Proxmark 3, but later I decided to add other features too. So you download the latest kernel source of Shuriken from here. If you want a prebuilt Zip file to flash it to your Oneplus 5/5T, you can download the raw zImage files and flashable zip from the release section.
Currently the Kernel Supports the following features:

1.	External WiFi USB Adapter
2.	HID Emulation
3.	CDC_ACM -> Proxmark/Chameleon Detection (all versions)
4.	Dynamic Module loading
5.  Hackrf/USB Ethernet/DVRs
6.	All other usual features of the Linux
